Some sorts of plasmoid life may exist in planetary ionospheres or interstellar space. the ionosphere\n[ S ] the part of the earth's atmosphere, from about 60 kilometres to about 1,000 kilometres above the surface, in which there are many ions (= atoms or groups of atoms that have an electrical charge): Altering the temperature of the ionosphere can affect the chemical reactions that produce ozone. Microwaves are able to pass through the ionosphere to reach satellites in space.

The Earth is surrounded by a blanket of charged particles - the ionosphere.Some electromagnetic radiation escapes from the Earth into space, whereas other types are confined by the ionosphere.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nThe Earth & outer space - general words\nablate\nanti-gravity\natmosphere\natmospherically\nauroral\ngeocentric\ngravity\nhorizon\nhydrosphere\nlithosphere\nlithospheric\nmacrocosm\nmesosphere\nmesospheric\nmicrogravity\nMother Nature\nthe Big Bang\nunderground\nweightlessness\nzero gravity\nSee more results »\nRelated word\nionospheric"}
