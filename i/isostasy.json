The term isostasy was introduced by the American geologist Dutton in 1889.\nMore examplesFewer examplesIn relation to the effect of isostasy in sea level rise, you should acquaint yourself with the work of Jerry Mitrovica and colleagues. Mallorca seems to be particularly well suited to the task, because neither tectonics nor isostasy over-complicate the record. This kind of behaviour, known as flexural isostasy, is especially important for oceanic lithosphere."}
