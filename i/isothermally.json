The column was operated isothermally at 130°C with helium as the carrier gas at 30 ml min 1.\nMore examplesFewer examplesThe latent heat is negligibly small, and the thermal conductivity, extremely large. This allows the melting and freezing to be modelled isothermally, and distinguishes helium from other substances.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nCold\nBaltic\nbitingly\nbitter\nbitterly\nbone-chilling\nbrass\nchilled\ncooling\ndank\nfrigid\nfrostbite\nfrozen\nisothermal\nkeenness\nminus\noccluded front\nperished\npiercingly\npolar vortex\nwintry\nSee more results »"}
