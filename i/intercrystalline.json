Inter-crystalline or interparticle voids are present in all rocks.\nMore examplesFewer examplesIn metals, the microstructure is formed by grains and inter-crystalline matter.The replacement reaction can proceed rapidly at all inter-crystalline boundaries. This can lead to inter-crystalline porosity.These crystals have a mostly continuous intercrystalline organic matrix.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nGeology: mineralogy\nbeneficiation\nconcentrate\ncrystalline\ndeposit\ngemologist\ngemology\ngold dust\ngraphite\nidiomorphic\nlike gold dust idiom\nmagnesium\nmineralogical\nnugget\npyrite\nquasicrystal\nseam\nsilicon\nvermiculite\nvulcanicity\nzircon\nSee more results »"}
