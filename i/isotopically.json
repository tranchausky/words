The carbon in these rocks is isotopically light, indicative of biological activity.\nMore examplesFewer examplesDetailed examinations of the comets showed that all three contain nearly identical concentrations of isotopically heavy water.The technique is easier, quicker, and more convenient than the clearance of isotopically labelled red cells.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nPhysics: atoms, molecules & sub-atomic particles\nacceptor\nanti-radical\nantilepton\nantimatter\nantineutrino\nbeta particle\nHiggs boson\nhydroxyl ion\ninteratomic\ninterelectronic\ninterionic\nintermolecular\nisotope\nmulti-molecular\nmultiparticle\nmuon\nneutrino\nnon-molecular\npositron\nrelative atomic mass\nSee more results »"}
