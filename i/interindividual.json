About 50% of this inter-individual variability is determined by the effect of genes. We will concentrate on interindividual similarities and differences.\nMore examplesFewer examplesThe model only accounts for less than half of the inter-individual variability we observed.Interindividual differences seem to be largely due to the relative volume of the body.Regarding the data from this single study, it is important to note that interindividual variation is quite great.Postprandial bile acid levels showed quite a large interindividual variation.Interindividual continuity focuses on stability across individuals over a period of time.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nParticular and individual\nbe the very thing idiom\nbiomarker\ncalling card\ncapita\ncertain\nespecially\nindividual\nindividualistic\nindividualistically\nindividuality\nindividualized\nindividually\nmatter\nper capita\npersonally\npet\nprivate\nrespectively\nseparately\nseverally\nSee more results »"}
