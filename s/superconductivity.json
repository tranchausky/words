In doing so, the group shattered the temperature record for superconductivity in an organic material. Superconductivity means the complete absence of electrical resistance. Superconductivity is a phenomenon of materials such that when you cool them, they will lose all of their resistance to electricity.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nElectricity & electronics\nanodize\nanti-static\narc\nbitstream\nbrownout\ncapacitance\nchargeable\nelectricity\nelectrify\ngenerate\nhigh-voltage\ninsulating tape\nlinesman\nmagnet\nmultimeter\nnegatively\nnon-electric\nnon-electrical\nnon-electronic\nsolid-state\nSee more results »"}
