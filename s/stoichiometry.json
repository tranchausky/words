We can find the stoichiometry of a reaction if we know the amounts of each reactant that react together and the amounts of each product formed.\nMore examplesFewer examplesIn the chemical industry, a knowledge of stoichiometry is essential for the calculation of the yields of chemical products.Stoichiometry is the calculation of relative quantities of reagents and their end-products in a chemical reaction.The stoichiometry of the equation is 1 : 3 : 2 : 3.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nChemistry - general words\nacceptor\naerosol\naerosolize\nallotrope\namphiprotic\nchemical formula\ndistilled water\nelectrolyte\nendocrine disruptor\nendothermic\nepitaxial\nepitaxially\nepitaxy\ninorganic chemistry\nionic bond\nnonelectrolyte\nnonreactive\npreatomic\nreactive\nreactivity\nSee more results »"}
