There appears to be limited stereospecificity for anti-malarial activity among the acids that we tested.\nMore examplesFewer examplesThis form of the fatty acid is favoured by nature, another example of stereospecificity. This circumvents the lengthy, inefficient organic synthesis that is otherwise required to create such stereospecificity.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nPhysical & chemical processes\nabsorbable\nabsorptive\nabsorptive capacity\nabsorptivity\nacidification\ncorrode\ndegradable\nexcitability\nexcitation\nexcite\nexergonic\nexothermic\nexothermic reaction\nimpregnate\nre-emission\nre-emit\nreabsorb\nreact\nreboil\nscald\nSee more results »\nRelated words\nstereospecific\nstereospecifically"}
