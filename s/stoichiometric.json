These salts were added in sufficient quantities to obtain the same stoichiometric balance as sea water.\nMore examplesFewer examplesStoichiometric equations can be used to calculate the volumes of the products of a reaction.There is a region where the fuel to oxidizer ratio is sufficiently close to the stoichiometric ratio for combustion to occur.One method is based on the stoichiometric calculation of the reactive iron.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nChemistry - general words\nacceptor\naerosol\naerosolize\nallotrope\namphiprotic\nchemical formula\ndistilled water\nelectrolyte\nendocrine disruptor\nendothermic\nepitaxial\nepitaxially\nepitaxy\ninorganic chemistry\nionic bond\nnonelectrolyte\nnonreactive\npreatomic\nreactive\nreactivity\nSee more results »\nRelated words\nstoichiometry\nstoichiometrically"}
