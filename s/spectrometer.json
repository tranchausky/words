They used a spectrometer to analyse the frequency of radiation reflected from the surface of Mars. See also\nmass spectrometer\nMore examplesFewer examplesEssentially, the spectrometer is a magnetic tunnel that tracks particles flowing through it.The probe would carry infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers, devices that spread light into its component colours to identify chemical compounds.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nPhysics: radiation & radioactivity\nalpha particle\nbackground radiation\ndecay\nelectromagnetic radiation\ngamma radiation\ngamma ray\nirradiated\nirradiation\nluminosity\nnon-ionizing\nnon-irradiated\nradioactive\nradioactively\nradioactivity\nradioisotope\nsievert\ntritium\nUVA\nUVB\nweak force\nSee more results »"}
