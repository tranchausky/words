The synchrotron was expected to generate light beams around 10,000 times more brilliant than existing sources.\nMore examplesFewer examplesSynchrotrons are capable of producing light over a broad range, from infrared to X-rays.A large number of synchrotron facilities were already in operation.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nLaboratory equipment\nbell jar\nBuchner funnel\nBunsen burner\ncalorimeter\ncollecting flask\ncondenser\nconical flask\nevaporating dish\nflame test\nflask\ngraduated cylinder\nmicroscope\noscilloscope\nparticle accelerator\nphotometer\npipette\nretort stand\nsiphon\ntest tube\ntransducer\nSee more results »\nYou can also find related words, phrases, and synonyms in the topics:\nMachines - general words\nPhysics: atoms, molecules & sub-atomic particles"}
