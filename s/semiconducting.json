The addition of minute quantities of aluminium to silicon will increase its semiconducting properties. See\nsemiconductor\nMore examplesFewer examplesThe team measured the semiconducting properties of metal oxides at high temperatures.Ordinary nitrogen gas, solidified at high pressure, turns into a semiconducting solid.These look like leaves but are close-ups of semiconducting polymers used in solar panels.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nElectricity & electronics\nanodize\nanti-static\narc\nbitstream\nbrownout\ncapacitance\nchargeable\nelectricity\nelectrify\ngenerate\nhigh-voltage\ninsulating tape\nlinesman\nmagnet\nmultimeter\nnegatively\nnon-electric\nnon-electrical\nnon-electronic\nsolid-state\nSee more results »"}
