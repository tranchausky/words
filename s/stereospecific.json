The effect of this drug has been shown to be stereospecific.\nMore examplesFewer examplesOne would expect these molecules to be central for the synthesis of stereospecific biomolecules. Synthetic chemists have improved reagents and reactions for difficult stereospecific syntheses. In a living organism, the membrane building blocks are synthesized with the help of these stereospecific enzymes.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nPhysical & chemical processes\nabsorbable\nabsorptive\nabsorptive capacity\nabsorptivity\nacidification\ncorrode\ndegradable\nexcitability\nexcitation\nexcite\nexergonic\nexothermic\nexothermic reaction\nimpregnate\nre-emission\nre-emit\nreabsorb\nreact\nreboil\nscald\nSee more results »\nRelated words\nstereospecifically\nstereospecificity"}
