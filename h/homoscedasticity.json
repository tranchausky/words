In several cases, the homoscedasticity assumption could not be met. It is possible to estimate this model to ensure homoskedasticity.\nMore examplesFewer examplesThe second innovation is the relaxation of the assumption of homoscedasticity, which led to the following findings.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nStatistics\nactuarial\nasymmetric\nbackground variable\ncategorical variable\ncentral tendency\ncontextual variable\nentropic\nentropically\nGaussian distribution\nidentifiability\ninfant mortality\nmedian\nodds\nresponse variable\nstandard deviation\nstat\nstatistic\nstatistically\nstochastic\nunadjusted\nSee more results »"}
