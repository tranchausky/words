All photonuclear reactions are endoergic. Compare\nendothermic\nMore examplesFewer examplesEnergy has been absorbed and the reaction is therefore endoergic.This is an endoergic reaction in which a neutron is emitted.This kinetic energy must be exceeded in any reaction between two charged particles, including endoergic ones.For endoergic reactions to take place, a certain amount of kinetic energy is required.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nPhysical & chemical processes\nabsorbable\nabsorptive\nabsorptive capacity\nabsorptivity\nacidification\ncorrode\ndegradable\nexcitation\nexcite\nexergonic\nexothermic\nexothermic reaction\nfermentation\nimpregnate\nre-emit\nreabsorb\nreact\nreboil\nrecondense\nscald\nSee more results »\nYou can also find related words, phrases, and synonyms in the topics:\nPhysics: energy, force & power"}
