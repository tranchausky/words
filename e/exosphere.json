An exosphere is the upper part of any planetary atmosphere, where the density of atoms is so low that they don't collide with each other. the exosphere\n[ S ] the part of the earth's atmosphere that is farthest from the earth: The temperature at the base of the exosphere is about 1300 K. Atoms of hydrogen, helium, sodium, potassium and calcium have been seen in the exosphere.
