In the root, water which has crossed the cortex, endodermis and pericycle moves into the xylem vessels through the pits in their walls. The researchers discovered that a protein molecule moves from the vascular cylinder to the endodermis, an inner skin within the root.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nParts of plants\nbilobed\nblade\nbough\nbulb\ncaning\ncascara sagrada\ncorolla\nexodermis\npine needle\nrhizome\nspine\nsprig\nsting\nstinger\nstoma\nstubbly\ntea leaf\ntrilobed\nvariegation\nvascular\nSee more results »"}
