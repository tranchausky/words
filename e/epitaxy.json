Molecular beam epitaxy is a way of creating perfect crystals, one layer of atoms at a time.\nMore examplesFewer examplesThe coatings are formed using a variety of techniques, including epitaxy.Epitaxy allows us to construct a crystalline structure of atoms, with each layer just a few atoms thick.Epitaxy is a method for growing single crystals on a growing film surface.The development of epitaxy allowed us to have far more precision in the process.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nChemistry - general words\nacceptor\naerosol\naerosolize\nallotrope\namphiprotic\nchemical formula\ndistilled water\nelectrolyte\nendocrine disruptor\nendothermic\nepitaxial\nepitaxially\nexothermic\ninorganic chemistry\nionic bond\nnonreactive\npreatomic\nreactive\nreactivity\nreduction\nSee more results »"}
