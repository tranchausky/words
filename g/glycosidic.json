The sugars are joined by glycosidic linkages, forming polymers of varying sizes.\nMore examplesFewer examplesPolysaccharides are made by joining many monosaccharide molecules, with each successive monosaccharide being added by means of a glycosidic bond.Here, the glycosidic bond is formed between carbon atoms 1 and 4 of neighbouring monosaccharides.This enzyme cleaves the bond between the carbon atom and the glycosidic oxygen atom.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nPhysics: atoms, molecules & sub-atomic particles\nacceptor\nanti-radical\nantilepton\nantimatter\nantineutrino\nbeta particle\nhydroxyl ion\ninteratomic\ninterelectronic\ninterionic\nintermolecular\nintermolecularly\nisotope\nmulti-molecular\nmultiparticle\nmuon\nneutrino\nnon-molecular\npositron\nrelative atomic mass\nSee more results »"}
