Trained initially in geology and then geochemistry, he more recently gained experience in geophysics research.\n[ S ] the mixture of chemical elements in the earth's crust (= its hard outer layer): For anyone interested in the geochemistry or mineralogy of carbonates, this book is an important read. The geochemistry of the basalts indicates that a composite oceanic crust was forming during Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous times.\nMore examplesFewer examplesWe hope that this book will meet the expectations of the researcher in geochemistry.This paper addresses the volcanology and geochemistry of the volcanic rocks on the island.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nGeology - general words\nAnthropocene\nanticline\nauriferous\nbiozone\ncarboniferous\ncementation\ncontinental crust\ncontinental plate\ngeomorphic\ngully erosion\nhenge\nHolocene\nhoodoo\npetrographically\npetrography\npetrological\npetrologically\npetrology\nPrecambrian\nrockfall\nSee more results »\nYou can also find related words, phrases, and synonyms in the topics:\nChemistry - general words"}
