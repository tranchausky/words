As the Universe expands and gets colder, the gravitationally accumulated matter undergoes stabilization.The space around the object contains pieces that have been decoupled physically, but not gravitationally, from its surface.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nPhysics: energy, force & power\nanimal magnetism\nanti-gravity\natmospheric pressure\nattract\nattraction\nballistic\nerg\nexcited\nfrictional\nfrictionless\nfundamental force\ngeothermal\ninertia\nself-propulsion\nsine curve\nsinusoid\nsolarize\nspecific heat\nthe sound barrier\nthermodynamics\nSee more results »"}
