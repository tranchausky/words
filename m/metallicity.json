Compared to the Sun, 47 Tucanae has less than a third the metallicity.\nMore examplesFewer examplesThe greater a star's metallicity, the better its chances to have planets.If the metallicity is too low, there is not enough material to build Earth-like planets.The process can make planets with enriched metallicities as seen in our own solar system.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nPhysics: the state of matter\nabsorbency\nacidic\nallotropic\nallotropy\ncompressible\ncrystalline\ne-liquid\nfluidity\ngranulated\nimpervious\nmelted\npolyunsaturated\nreflective\nrustily\nrusty\nself-healing\nsloppily\nsloppiness\nsloppy\nspectrally\nSee more results »"}
