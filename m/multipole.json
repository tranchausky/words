Eriksson looked at the nonlinear motion of a rigid conductor in a multipole field.\nrelating to a mathematical calculation that involves a series of terms, used especially for solving problems in physics: multipole expansion multipole methods\nMore examplesFewer examplesWe will ignore the interference between different multipole components. Further terms for a full multipole expansion can be obtained by differentiation. The multipole moments here are defined in the same global frame.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nPhysics: energy, force & power\nanimal magnetism\nanti-gravity\natmospheric pressure\nattract\nattraction\nballistic\nerg\nexcited\nfrictional\nfrictionless\nfundamental force\ngeothermal\ninertia\nself-propulsion\nsine curve\nsinusoid\nsolarize\nspecific heat\nthe sound barrier\nthermodynamics\nSee more results »\nYou can also find related words, phrases, and synonyms in the topics:\nCalculations & calculating"}
