Water ice clouds form in planets' mesospheres by vapour deposition at low pressures and temperatures. the mesosphere\n[ S ] the layer of gases surrounding the earth at a height of between 50 and 100 kilometres: Extreme cold is needed to form ice in a dry environment like the mesosphere. Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.

Planetary mesospheres are impacted by energetic processes occurring within the deep atmosphere. The temperature in the mesosphere decreases rapidly with an increase in altitude.Although summer is the warmest time of year on the ground, this is the coldest season in the mesosphere.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nThe Earth & outer space - general words\nablate\nanti-gravity\natmosphere\natmospherically\nauroral\ngeocentric\ngravity\nhorizon\nhydrosphere\nionospheric\nlithosphere\nlithospheric\nmacrocosm\nmesospheric\nmicrogravity\nMother Nature\nthe Big Bang\nunderground\nweightlessness\nzero gravity\nSee more results »\nAdd to word list\nAdd to word list\nearth science the layer of gases surrounding the earth at a height of between 50 and 100 kilometers, above the stratosphere"}
