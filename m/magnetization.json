Evidence of past magnetization is contained in individual rock samples.\nMore examplesFewer examplesIn these cases, the magnetisation is proportional to the external field.This technique provides unique capabilities for the visualization of magnetization patterns.A study of rock samples from the right and left of the cavity has shown that its magnetization switches round at regular intervals.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nChemistry: metals & metalworking\nalloy\nanti-tarnish\nbar magnet\nbase metal\nbimetallic\nblacksmith\nbrazen\nbrazier\nbullion\nferrous\ngold leaf\nlode\nmagnet\nscrap\ntarnished\ntinplated\nuntarnished\nvermeil\nwrought iron\nzirconium\nSee more results »\nRelated word\nmagnetize"}
