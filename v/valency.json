His theory was that carbon had a combining power (valency) of four or two and a unique capacity for joining itself to other atoms of its own kind. Sodium is useful in a great many compounds as a substitute for one of the two atoms of hydrogen (also valence 1) in a variety of acids.\nlanguage\n&#160; specialized A verb's valency or valence is the number of noun phrases with which it combines. : Many verbs can have a different valency depending on the meaning in which they are being used. A verb such as \"hand\", with a subject, an object, and an indirect object, as in \"she handed me the plate\", has a valency of three. These generic verbs are excellent models for analogy to other verbs of the same valency. Valence is a property of verbs indicating the number of arguments a verb requires to make a clause.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nChemistry - general words\nacceptor\naerosol\naerosolize\nallotrope\namphiprotic\nchemical formula\ndistilled water\nelectrolyte\nendocrine disruptor\nendothermic\nepitaxial\nepitaxially\nepitaxy\ninorganic chemistry\nionic bond\nnonelectrolyte\nnonreactive\npreatomic\nreactive\nreactivity\nSee more results »\nYou can also find related words, phrases, and synonyms in the topics:\nLinguistics: grammatical terms"}
