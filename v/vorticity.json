Vorticity is generated as the cylinder moves through the fluid.\nMore examplesFewer examplesThe relative vorticity becomes negative (anticyclonic) as latitude increases. Researchers attempted to quantify blood flow distribution and vorticity towards the pulmonary arteries.The amount of vorticity varies.The vorticity vector gives the average density and direction of the vortices.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nWind & winds\nanemometer\nblast\nbreeze\nchinook\ncyclonic\neasterly\njet stream\nleeward\nnorthwesterly\nsigh\nsirocco\nslipstream\nsouthwester\nsquall\nstiff\nthe Coriolis effect\ntornado\nwindblown\nwindswept\nwuthering\nSee more results »\nYou can also find related words, phrases, and synonyms in the topics:\nMovement of liquids\nRelated word\nvortex"}
