Geologists worked hard to discover what plate tectonics revealed about Earth's past.The role of tectonics is absolutely critcal in understanding those changes in early humans.Depending on the geology, the tectonics and thus the topography of the earth's surface beneath it, it may be many miles deep or some few fathoms shallow.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nGeology - general words\nAnthropocene\nanticline\nauriferous\nbiozone\ncarboniferous\ncementation\ncontinental crust\ncontinental plate\ngeologically\ngeomorphic\ngully erosion\nhenge\nHolocene\npetrographic\npetrographically\npetrography\npetrological\npetrologically\nPrecambrian\nrockfall\nSee more results »"}
