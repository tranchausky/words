This image shows the thermomagnetic behaviour of the materials as they are heated and cooled to different temperatures.\nMore examplesFewer examplesThe thermomagnetic properties of the compound were measured under a fixed magnetic field and under the application of different constant electrical fields.These results were confirmed by the thermomagnetic experiments.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nElectricity & electronics\nanodize\nanti-static\narc\nbitstream\nbrownout\ncapacitance\nchargeable\nelectricity\nelectrify\ngenerate\nhigh-voltage\ninsulating tape\nlinesman\nmagnet\nmultimeter\nnegatively\nnon-electric\nnon-electrical\nnon-electronic\nsolid-state\nSee more results »"}
