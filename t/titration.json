We described above the titration procedure for determining the amount of acid required to neutralize an alkali. In the practical session we tackled about ten titrations each in three hours.\nmedical\n&#160; specialized the act of calculating and, if necessary, changing how much of a drug, etc. is given to a patient in order to produce the best result, without causing too many side effects (= unpleasant effects that happen in addition to the main intended effect): Despite careful titration of sedative doses, individual patient responses are variable. Too rapid titration for the patient’s sensitivity may produce adverse effects. Insulin acts rapidly and responds quickly to dose titrations.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nMeasuring & weighing\ncost-of-living index\ncountable\ngage\ngravimetric\ngravimetrically\nhypsometric\nmeasure\nmeasurement\nnon-quantifiable\nnon-quantitative\npace\npace something off/out\nplanimetric\nponderable\nproof\nshortish\nsurvey\nunquantifiable\nunsounded\nweigh something out\nSee more results »\nYou can also find related words, phrases, and synonyms in the topics:\nChemistry - general words\nDrugs - general words\nRelated words\ntitrate\ntitrant"}
