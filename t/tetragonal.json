When heated from room temperature, the crystals change to show tetragonal symmetry.\nMore examplesFewer examplesTwo crystal forms were obtained; one had tetragonal symmetry, and the second had hexagonal symmetry.The symmetry of the tetragonal system requires the crystal to have three axes, with two of them equal in length and the third axis either longer or shorter than the other two.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nGeometrical shapes\n-cornered\ncircularly\ncone\ncongruently\nconic\ncrescent\ncylindrically\nisosceles triangle\novoid\npolyhedron\npolytope\nprism\npyramid\nrectangular\nrectangularly\nrhombus\nright triangle\nsemicircle\nthree-dimensional\ntrapezoid\nSee more results »"}
