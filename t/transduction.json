See also\nco-transduction\nMore examplesFewer examplesHis discovery of transduction in bacterial genes opened up the possibility of genetic engineering.The technique of using viruses to transfer DNA into bacteria, called \"transduction\", had not previously been used with streptomyces.Transduction seems to involve fragments of DNA too small to be of serious ecological importance. Gene transduction with these retroviral agents is essentially restricted to dividing cells.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nGenetics\nadenine\nanaphase\nautosomal\nautosomally\nautosome\ngenomic\ngenomics\ngermline\ngermplasm\nhalf-breed\nheredity\nheterozygous\nhomozygous\noncogene\npanmictic\npanmixia\nparthenogenetic\nPatau syndrome\npaternally\nrecessive\nSee more results »\ntransduction noun [U]\n(OF ENERGY)\nphysics\n&#160; specialized the act of changing energy from one form to another: the transduction of physical wave to mechanical impulse or electrical signal Vision is based on the transduction of light stimuli received through the eyes.
