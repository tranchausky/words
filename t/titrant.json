Continue adding titrant in small quantities, and as the titration progresses, the colour change will take longer to disappear. Related words\ntitrate\ntitration\nMore examplesFewer examplesIf 0·1 M NaOH is used as titrant, it is not sufficiently sensitive to detect activity.Total acidity was tested following the alkaline titrimetric method using NaOH as the titrant.It is important to know the exact titrant concentration for correct titration results, especially in the case of self-made titrants.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nChemistry - general words\nacceptor\naerosol\naerosolize\nallotrope\namphiprotic\nchemical formula\ndistilled water\nelectrolyte\nendocrine disruptor\nendothermic\nepitaxial\nepitaxially\nepitaxy\ninorganic chemistry\nionic bond\nnonelectrolyte\nnonreactive\npreatomic\nreactive\nreactivity\nSee more results »"}
