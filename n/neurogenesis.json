The growth of new brain cells – a process called neurogenesis – is involved in new memory formation.\nMore examplesFewer examplesRecent discoveries show that adults sprout new brain cells throughout life, a process called neurogenesis.After that, neurogenesis occurs as precursor cells mature to become neurons.By the time the clinical expression of schizophrenia is apparent, neurogenesis and development is essentially complete."}
