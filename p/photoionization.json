They used photoionization to examine the structure of the molecule.\nMore examplesFewer examplesThe photoionisation rates are included in the model.The ultraviolet radiation field causes the photoionization of the molecules.Photoionization was the main process that they used to generate an electrical charge.The electrons that were released as a result of photoionization had sufficient energy for further ionization to take place.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nElectricity & electronics\nanodize\nanti-static\narc\nbitstream\nbrownout\ncapacitance\nchargeable\nelectricity\nelectrify\ngenerate\nhigh-voltage\ninsulating tape\nlinesman\nmagnet\nmultimeter\nnegatively\nnon-electric\nnon-electrical\nnon-electronic\nsolid-state\nSee more results »"}
