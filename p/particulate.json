Studies have linked exposure to particulates in air pollution with increased risk for heart disease.\nMore examplesFewer examplesMasks are available to filter out the dangerous particulates in the air. Most fine particulates result from human activity, usually from burning oil, coal, diesel or wood. Boilers often have very short chimneys, which limits the dispersion of the smoke and its particulates.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nEnvironmental issues\nagroecology\nair pollution\nanoxia\nanoxic\nanti-conservation\ncarbon capture\ndumping ground\neco-footprint\nenvironmentalism\nenvironmentally\nESG\nfeed-in tariff\nfood insecure\nreclamation\nreduce, reuse, recycle idiom\nsequester\nsequestration\nsingle-use\nskip diving\nsmoggy\nSee more results »\nconsisting of small pieces of dirt, especially ones produced by road vehicles, that cause pollution: health risks posed by particulate matter Particulate pollution is unhealthy at the levels recorded last summer.\nMore examplesFewer examplesFine particulate matter and ground-level ozone levels have shown no appreciable decrease.Natural-gas generators have lower particulate emissions.The friction creates microscopic particulate debris.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nEnvironmental issues\nagroecology\nair pollution\nanoxia\nanoxic\nanti-conservation\ncarbon capture\ndumping ground\neco-footprint\nenvironmentalism\nenvironmentally\nESG\nfeed-in tariff\nfood insecure\nreclamation\nreduce, reuse, recycle idiom\nsequester\nsequestration\nsingle-use\nskip diving\nsmoggy\nSee more results »\nAdd to word list\nAdd to word list\nscience relating to or consisting of very small pieces of a substance"}
