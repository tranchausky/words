Photorespiration happens because the enzyme that powers photosynthesis has trouble distinguishing between carbon dioxide and oxygen molecules. Compare\nphotosynthesis\nMore examplesFewer examplesIn photorespiration, plants take up oxygen and release carbon dioxide without making food. The chemical reactions, collectively called photorespiration, may explain why some plants don't fare well under global warming.Scientists have been trying to genetically engineer plants with a better ability to discriminate between oxygen and carbon dioxide, thereby suppressing photorespiration.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nFlowers - general words\nabscission\nanther\nbloom\nblossom\nchasmogamous\ncleistogamous\ndouble\nefflorescence\nfemale\ngrow\nhead\nin flower idiom\nmulti-headed\npalynological\npollen\nposy\nsepal\nstalk\nstamen\nstigma\nSee more results »"}
