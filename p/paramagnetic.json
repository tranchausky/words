This is a highly paramagnetic element and can therefore be visualized by MRI.\nMore examplesFewer examplesObjects containing ferromagnetic or paramagnetic materials may be drawn into the magnetic field, posing a serious safety hazard.The flow is distributed equally past the central magnetic core, where any paramagnetic particles are retained. Oxygen and water are paramagnetic and can carry a magnetic field to all parts of the body through blood circulation.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nChemistry: metals & metalworking\nalloy\nanti-tarnish\nbar magnet\nbase metal\nbimetallic\nblacksmith\nbrazen\nbrazier\nbullion\nferrous\ngold leaf\nlode\nmagnet\nscrap\ntarnished\ntinplated\nuntarnished\nvermeil\nwrought iron\nzirconium\nSee more results »\nYou can also find related words, phrases, and synonyms in the topics:\nElectricity & electronics\nCompare\nmagnetic\nferromagnetic"}
