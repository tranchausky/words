Photonuclear experiments were performed using high-peak power lasers.\nMore examplesFewer examplesMuons can be produced in the atmosphere by photonuclear interactions.Photonuclear reaction induced by ultra-intense laser was first proposed by Shkolnikov et al.We are evaluating additional photonuclear techniques, for example, photofission.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nPhysics: energy, force & power\nanimal magnetism\nanti-gravity\natmospheric pressure\nattract\nattraction\nballistic\nerg\nexcited\nfrictional\nfrictionless\nfundamental force\ngeothermal\ninertia\nself-propulsion\nsine curve\nsinusoid\nsolarize\nspecific heat\nthe sound barrier\nthermodynamics\nSee more results »"}
