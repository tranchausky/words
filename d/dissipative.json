There is an essential tension between energy inflow and dissipative outflow.\nMore examplesFewer examplesDissipative systems lose energy through some dissipative mechanism such as friction or viscosity.As a result, we obtain the dissipative term, which depends on the mobility of charged particles.All the molecules in a dissipative structure are in cooperative interaction.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nPhysical & chemical processes\nabsorbable\nabsorptive\nabsorptive capacity\nabsorptivity\nacidification\ncorrode\ndegradable\nexcitation\nexcite\nexergonic\nexothermic\nexothermic reaction\nfermentation\nimpregnate\nre-emit\nreabsorb\nreact\nreboil\nrecondense\nscald\nSee more results »\nRelated words\ndissipate\ndissipation"}
