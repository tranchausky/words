Making a core from thin iron sheets, interleaved with an insulating material, brings the coercivity of the core down without harming its useful properties.\nMore examplesFewer examplesCoercivity can be obtained where the radiating surfaces emit part of the radiation out of the system.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nChemistry: metals & metalworking\nalloy\nanti-tarnish\nbar magnet\nbase metal\nbimetallic\nblacksmith\nbrazen\nbrazier\nbullion\nferrous\ngold leaf\nlode\nmagnet\nscrap\ntarnished\ntinplated\nuntarnished\nvermeil\nwrought iron\nzirconium\nSee more results »"}
