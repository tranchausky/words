Earth's cryosphere—its high-latitude regions of snow and ice—represents a central piece of the climate system.\nMore examplesFewer examplesScientists hope to achieve a better understanding of the dynamics of the various types of ice in the Antarctic cryosphere.James Lovelock presented his theory that the biosphere and physical components of the Earth - atmosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere - form an interacting system. Climate change may affect the hydrological cycle, the carbon cycle, and the cryosphere among other climate elements.Scientists who are experts in the cryosphere do not agree with his comments.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nCountries, nationalities & continents: continents & regions of the world\nAfrocentric\nAfrocentrism\namazonian\nAntarctica\nAntipodean\nblack Africa\nCaribbean\nLATAM\nLatin America\nlatitudinal\nlatitudinally\nLevantine\nlongitude\nmeridian\nparallel\npole\nthe Antipodes\nthe prime meridian\nthe South Pole\nthe Tropic of Cancer\nSee more results »\nYou can also find related words, phrases, and synonyms in the topics:\nIce\nEnvironmental issues"}
