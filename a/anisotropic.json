This means that its properties depend on direction. Carbon fibre is anisotropic, meaning it possesses directional stiffness. anisotropic conductivity Compare\nisotropic specialized\nMore examplesFewer examplesElectron scattering is anisotropic and the scattering amplitudes peak strongly in the forward direction.Water diffusion in white matter is highly anisotropic i.e. not equal in all directions.Shock waves in plasmas with strongly anisotropic viscosity and thermal conductivity are considered. In 3D computer graphics, anisotropic filtering is a method of enhancing the image quality of textures."}
