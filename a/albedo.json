Scientists detected what could be a 2.5 percent decrease in Earth's albedo over the past five years. the albedo effect\nenvironment\n&#160; specialized the effect produced by the light and heat of the sun being reflected back from surfaces on Earth into the atmosphere: The albedo effect - the reflection of 80% of the sun's heat by the snow and ice - keeps temperatures in the region cool.\nSee more\nMore examplesFewer examplesEnceladus has an albedo greater than 90 percent, whereas the Earth and its moon have albedos of 38 percent and 12 percent, respectively.The object discovered by astronomers is believed to have a diameter of roughly 550 miles, based on assumptions of its surface reflectivity, or albedo. Sagebrush has a much lower albedo than wildflowers - that is, it reflects less sunlight back into space, causing even more warming.As the meadows vanish, a beneficial feedback loop - in which their high albedo helps to cool the world - is replaced by a harmful one. It is not entirely clear why the Arctic is warming much more quickly than other areas. One factor is probably albedo, or the heat-reflecting value of ice.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nGiving out light\nafire\nbeam\nbeamy\nbioluminescence\nburnished\ncandlelit\nflicker\ngleam\nglimmer\nglitter\nilluminate\nnoctilucent\nnon-glare\nnon-luminous\nout-glitter\npearlescence\nreflected ray\nshine\nspotlight\nwink\nSee more results »\nYou can also find related words, phrases, and synonyms in the topics:\nAstronomy"}
