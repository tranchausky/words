The new coating creates a surface with excellent absorptivity.\nthe ability of a substance to be absorbed (= taken in and held or used), for example by the skin or the body: They measured the absorptivity of three different moisturizing creams. The study looks at the factors affecting the absorptivity of nutrients.\nMore examplesFewer examplesLonger-wavelength radiation would have a higher absorptivity and would be absorbed in the outer layers 0f the sample.Because absorbance is a dimensionless quality, the units used to express absorptivity depend on the other parameters relevant to the measurement.The reformulated ointment has improved absorptivity of its active ingredient.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nPhysical & chemical processes\nabsorbable\nabsorptive\nabsorptive capacity\nacidification\naddition reaction\ncorrode\ndegradable\nexcitation\nexcite\nexergonic\nexothermic\nexothermic reaction\nfermentation\nimpregnate\nre-emit\nreabsorb\nreact\nreboil\nrecondense\nscald\nSee more results »"}
