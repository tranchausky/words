Electrons, protons, and quarks are all fermions.\nMore examplesFewer examplesFor a long time, cosmologists had expected the plasma to be a gas of weakly interacting fermions.A fermion can be thought of as containing a tiny bar magnet.In the 1970s, scientists divided particles into two families, bosons and fermions, according to their spin pattern.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nPhysics: atoms, molecules & sub-atomic particles\nacceptor\nanti-radical\nantilepton\nantimatter\nantineutrino\nbeta particle\nhydroxyl ion\ninteratomic\ninterelectronic\ninterionic\nintermolecular\nintermolecularly\nisotope\nmulti-molecular\nmultiparticle\nmuon\nneutrino\nnon-molecular\npositron\nrelative atomic mass\nSee more results »"}
