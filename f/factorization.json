The factorisation of 48 yields 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48. The question asks students to perform a factorization of 160.\nMore examplesFewer examplesFactorisation is taught early on in the mathematics syllabus.Matrix factorizations have been considered as tools for data analysis here.\nSMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases\nAddition, subtraction, multiplication & division\nadd\nadd (something) up\naddition sign\nadditive\narithmetical\ncoefficient\ndeduction\nhalf\nhalve\nhighest common factor\nlong division\npower\nquintuple\nrecursion\nround something down\nsubtraction sign\nsubtractive\ntable\ntimes\ntreble\nSee more results »\nRelated word\nfactorize"}
